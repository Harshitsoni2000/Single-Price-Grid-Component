## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Styled Components](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@4.6.0/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css) - For styles

### What I learned

I learned about place-self property which can be used in both, flexbox and grid.

```html
<div class="container">Some Code</div>
```
```css
.container {
  place-self: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on improving my layout management skills in future projects. These come in handy while building a website.

### Useful resources

- [place-self](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/place-self) - This helped me understand an important property called place-self, which can be used to center an item on the page instead of using both, the justify-content and align-items property.
